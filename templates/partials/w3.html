        <p>I am a Python Test Engineer. I live in Brighton, UK.
        </p>
        <p>I have a background in Web based business applications, AI, ML, Django, Python,WordPress, JavaScript and
          finance.</p>

      </div>


      <p>As a former Microsoft Certified DBA (SQL 2000), I have a strong interest in data integrity as well as using
        browser storage (IndexedDB) for robust and fast data retrieval.</p>
      <p>I originally trained as an Accountant Technician, working freelance for a range of SMEs. This
        enables me
        to speak both business and development, bridging the gap between these two worlds, leading to a role as a
        Business Information Architect<span id="cv"></span> for a nationwide recycling
        company. </p>
      <p>At this time, I am developing a range of incrementally functional Test Suites with documentation, videos and
        templates for
        developers and testers - <a

        <li><a href="https://wp-html.co.uk/wp-rest-api" target="blank">WordPress REST API and AJAX Forms and Pages</a>
          opens up the possibility of WP being used 100% of the Internet, a topic I have spoken about at WordCamps
          and used in non-WP talks and workshops. I created an online course on creating REST APIs for pages and
          forms that do not need to be refreshed for commercial reasons as well as being able to offer a free
          resource to attendees at WordCamp workshops.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://wp-html.co.uk" target="_blank">WP-HTML</a> creates Custom HTML tags, (Web Components)
          that are part of the browser specifications. They have two powerful characteristics:
          <p>1). They are fully
            encapsulated preventing bleeding out of CSS and JS, as well as having protocols for passing CSS and
            functionality between them and the web page. 2). Attributes in the the Custom HTML tag can be configured
            to
            be 'watched', so that when we change them programatically, they create a rerender of the tag.</p>
          <p>
            This site has a variety of Custom HTML tags, in a headless WordPress site. Combined with added
            functionality of using the Intersection Observer API, (lazy loading), and IndexedDB,( the browser's own
            database), to store posts locally
            for offline and near instant access, we can create a WP site that has all the modern day power of JS
            Frameworks, yet code
            our page <em>semantically</em>.
          </p>
          <p>By making use of certain events in the browser like page loaded or teh Browser Idel API, we can manage
            our local database of posts so that data is accessed locally rather than through network requests.
            Additionaly. the use of a Service Worker JS file, we can create a local web server, as it were, to
            increase our offline and near instant page load.</p>

        <li><a href="https://wp-html.co.uk/plugin-boilerplate" target="_blank">WP Plugin Boilerplate</a>
          <p>
            This is a YouTube video series with GitHub repo and pdf guide to set up the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate
            along
            with the following included in the app:
          <ol>
            <li>Create admin pages links.</li>
            <li>Create a custom MySQL table and have some pre-made CRUD operations.</li>
            <li>Create a REST API. (I have an online course <em>'WP REST API for AJAX pages and forms'</em>, that is
              also given
              to attendees at WordCamp and MeetUp workshops and talks.)</li>
            <li>Create an admin form with image uploader that uses the REST API and WP-Nonce for security to upload
              events
              to
              the custom
              MySQL table.</li>
            <li>Admin list pages of events with edit and delete facilities using REST API.</li>
            <li>Creating of blank pages as a placeholder for demo JS, React and Svelte apps, using
              page_template_filter to
              have the HTML
              within the plugin rather than a custom page, thereby making the plugin and its pages self-contained.

          Forms are a converstation with users. The base form has live validation, AJAX requests and error
          handling and styling. Use of other JS libraries such as RxJS Streams, React, and Svelte are also used to
          give the best
          possible user and developer experience.
